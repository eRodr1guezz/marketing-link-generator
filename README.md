# Welcome to the Campaign URL Builder!

The purpose of this URL generator tool is to help you quickly and easily create trackable URLs for your project that utilize the organizations unique marketing parameters.

If you ever run into a bug/issue with the builder, please feel free to reach out to me directly any time @ brent.abruzese@gmail.com! You can also send me a DM on Slack!

All you'll need to get started with the builder is a base URL! This will be the URL of the website you are using in your project.

After that, you'll simply select what areas of the Business this will be for - ie. MedscapeLive or Medscape etc. Upon selecting that Business unit, another dropdown will emerge with a selection of Business Unit Subcategories. This will allow you to further dial into the unique area of the organization your project lives.

There is also a Therapeutic Area dropdown that can be toggled on or off if necessary - this will allow you to choose the Therapeutic area of the project, ie. Derm.

At this point, the project has generated a "Root URL" under the hood. That Root URL will be the new basis for all the generated URLs you create when adding Campaign Drivers!

A "Driver" is the unique method you're using in your marketing campaign - for example, Email or Social Media. After a driver is created, the tool will also allow you to generate URLs for individual platforms, ie. Facebook or Twitter for Social Media, or define whether an Email is internal or external etc.

Note: You can add as many drivers as you'd like as long as you do not duplicate them!

Once you've chosen your drivers, you can click "Generate URL Campaign" to create your unique collection of URLs! This will display right on the bottom of the form under "Results". You are also given the option of exporting the results to a CSV file that can be opened in your favorite text editor or spreadsheet software, ie. Microsoft Excel/Apple Numbers!

You may also notice that there's a feature that allows you to shorten your URLs with Bit.ly! Once you've generated your URLs, simply click the button that says "Shorten URLS" and the results will reflect the new shortened URL! If you shorten a URL and need to reference it's original state, simply click the icon to the left of the URL and the original URL will be displayed in a window for you to view/copy!

I'm very excited to share this project with you! As of today, 05/11/22, it's officially available to begin demoing/using for projects you have. If you have any feedback or concerns don't hesitate to ask, I'd love to know what you think! Thank you!!
